A twitter bot that has to be kept alive with user interactions

------------------------------------

The bot will need likes(food) equal to 20% of it's following each day

The bot will need comments(play) equal to 5% of it's following each day

The bot will need retweets(motivation) equal to 1% of it's following per day

------------------------------------

If the bot meets the user interaction requirements it will gain a day of sustenance. I'll probably have 7 days total so assuming the bot starts at 4/7 if the bot gets enough likes, comments, and retweets it will go up to 5/7 for each respective one reached and if it doesn't it will got to 3/7 for each respective one reached.

If the bot reaches 0/7 in food, play, or motivation it will die :(
